## 2.0 User Install

Bootstraps the `ai/` framework directory into an existing project. Does not require cloning the repository. Always installs the latest release.

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- `curl`
- `bash`
- An existing project directory

### 2.2 Bootstrap

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/William12556/LLM-Governance-and-Orchestration/main/bin/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- <project-path>
```

Replace `<project-path>` with the absolute or relative path to the target project root.

### 2.3 Result

After bootstrap:

- `<project-path>/ai/` is created and populated with the framework
- `<project-path>/ai/ael/config.yaml` is generated from the default template

Review `config.yaml` before first use. It contains project-specific settings that must be verified manually.

## 3.0 Developer Install

For developing or extending the LLM-G&O framework.

### 3.1 Prerequisites

- `git`
- `gh` (GitHub CLI) — required for `bin/release.sh` only

### 3.2 Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/William12556/LLM-Governance-and-Orchestration.git
```

### 3.3 Propagate to a Downstream Project

After making changes to `ai/`, push updates to a downstream project:

```bash
bin/propagate.sh <project-root>
```

Run from the repository root. The target project must already have an `ai/` directory. See `bin/propagate.sh` for excluded files.

### 3.4 Create a Release

```bash
bin/release.sh
```

Archives `ai/`, creates a GitHub release, and attaches the tarball as a release asset. Requires `gh` authenticated to GitHub.

## Context

Claude Code version 2.1.0 was released January 7, 2026, representing a significant evolution from experimental tool to production infrastructure. The release includes 1,096 commits focused on agent lifecycle management, skills system formalization, and workflow orchestration capabilities.

The LLM Governance and Orchestration framework currently at version 5.6 defines a dual-domain architecture (Claude Desktop for planning, Claude Code for execution) with filesystem-based communication and strict protocol-driven workflows. This proposal examines how Claude Code 2.1.0's new capabilities align with and could enhance the existing governance model.

## Analysis

### Claude Code 2.1.0 Key Capabilities

**Skills System**:
- Hot-reload: Skills updated in `~/.claude/skills` or `.claude/skills` activate immediately without session restart
- Forked contexts: `context: fork` enables isolated sub-agent execution preventing unintended side effects
- Lifecycle hooks: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, and Stop hooks provide fine-grained control over agent behavior
- Custom agents: Skills can invoke specialized sub-agents for validation and testing

**Context Optimization**:
- CLAUDE.md files: Automatic context injection from repository root, parent directories, and home folder
- Multiple locations: Project-specific (checked into git) and personal (`.local` variants)
- Token efficiency: Reduces prompt verbosity by externalizing stable context (commands, conventions, patterns)

**Session Management**:
- Checkpointing: Automatic snapshots for every file change and user prompt
- Rewind capability: Restore previous state (code-only or full conversation)
- Session teleportation: Transfer sessions between local terminal and claude.ai/code interface

**Permission System**:
- Wildcard patterns: Simplified permission management (e.g., `Bash(npm:*)`, `Bash(git:*)`)
- Unified backgrounding: Ctrl+B backgrounds both agents and shell commands
- Allowlist persistence: Session-specific, project-level, and global permission configurations

**Automation Infrastructure**:
- Headless mode: Non-interactive execution for CI/CD pipelines (`claude -p "<prompt>"`)
- MCP notifications: `list_changed` enables dynamic tool/resource updates without reconnection
- Streaming JSON output: `--output-format stream-json` for programmatic integration

**Workflow Patterns** (from best practices):
- Explore-Plan-Code-Commit: Research → planning → implementation → git workflow
- Test-Driven Development: Write tests → verify failure → implement → iterate
- Visual iteration: Provide mock → implement → screenshot → refine
- Codebase Q&A: Onboarding and exploration through natural language queries

### Current Governance Framework State

The framework (version 5.6) incorporates:
- 11 protocols (P00-P10) defining systematic software development processes
- 7 templates (T01-T07) providing YAML-based document structures
- 3-tier design hierarchy (master → domain → component)
- UUID-based document coupling with iteration synchronization
- Document lifecycle management (active/closed states with immutable archival)
- Progressive validation strategy (targeted → integration → regression)
- Platform-agnostic specifications with deployment platform definitions in design documents

Framework strengths:
- Clear domain separation (Claude Desktop strategic, Claude Code tactical)
- Human approval gates at critical transitions
- Comprehensive traceability matrix requirements
- Token-efficient template designs

Framework gaps relative to Claude Code 2.1.0:
- No integration with skills system for reusable workflows
- Context optimization limited to governance.md reference
- Manual checkpoint management through git operations
- No validation hooks for continuous compliance checking
- Permission patterns require per-session configuration
- Limited automation infrastructure for CI/CD integration

**Proposed Changes**:

**P07 Enhancement - Add section 1.8.3 Validation Hooks**:
```markdown
- 1.8.3 Validation Hooks
  - PreToolUse Hook: Schema validation before file modifications
    - Verify T04 prompt contains complete design specifications
    - Validate JSON schema compliance for document structures
    - Check UUID format correctness in coupled document references
  - PostToolUse Hook: Protocol compliance verification after code generation
    - Verify generated files match design document specifications
    - Check coding standards compliance (PEP 8, type hints)
    - Validate test coverage requirements
  - Stop Hook: Cleanup and verification logging
    - Document hook execution results for audit trail
    - Verify iteration synchronization in coupled documents
    - Generate compliance summary report
  - Hook implementation: Define in .claude/skills/ with lifecycle specification
  - Hook logging: Results appended to workspace/admin/ for audit review
```

**P08 Enhancement - Modify section 1.9.4 Audit Procedure**:
```markdown
- Hook-based continuous auditing:
  - Claude Desktop: Reviews hook execution logs from workspace/admin/
  - Automated compliance tracking: PostToolUse hooks generate real-time findings
  - Audit report integration: Hook results incorporated into formal audit deliverables
  - Critical violations: PreToolUse hooks prevent non-compliant operations
```

**Hook Implementation Example**:
```yaml
# .claude/skills/governance/schema-validator.md
---
hooks:
  PreToolUse: |
    Verify all document modifications comply with template schema:
    - T01-T07 templates define required YAML structure
    - UUID format validation: ^[0-9a-f]{8}$
    - Iteration number consistency in coupled documents
    Abort operation if validation fails.
  PostToolUse: |
    Verify generated code matches design specifications:
    - Cross-reference implementation against Tier 3 component design
    - Check interface contracts, error handling, logging standards
    Log compliance status to workspace/admin/hook-results.log
context: fork
---
```

**Benefits**:
- Automated compliance checking reduces manual audit burden

**Rationale**: Wildcard patterns reduce permission prompt fatigue during repetitive operations. Integration improves developer experience without compromising safety.

**Proposed Changes**:

**P09 Enhancement - Modify section 1.10.3 Human Handoff**:
```markdown
- Command structure includes recommended wildcard patterns:
  - File editing: --allowedTools Edit
  - Git operations: Bash(git:*)
  - Package management: Bash(npm:*) or Bash(pip:*)
  - Testing: Bash(pytest:*)
- Example command:
  ```
  claude --allowedTools Edit Bash(git:*) Bash(pytest:*) \
    # For reference: governance at '/path/to/ai/governance.md'
    # For context: designs in '/path/to/workspace/design'
    # Implement: '/path/to/workspace/prompt/prompt-<uuid>-<name>.md'
  ```
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces interruptions during code generation cycles
- Maintains safety through scoped wildcard patterns
- Improves workflow efficiency without architectural changes

**Rationale**: Headless mode enables CI/CD integration for automated compliance checking. Deferred to future phase pending stability assessment.

**Proposed Changes** (Future Consideration):

**P08 Enhancement - Add section 1.9.10 Automated Audits**:
```markdown
- 1.9.10 Automated Audits
  - Headless invocation: claude -p "<audit prompt>" --output-format stream-json
  - CI/CD integration: Configuration audit on pull request creation
  - Automated protocol compliance: PreToolUse hooks execute in headless mode
  - Report generation: Audit findings output to workspace/audit/ without human interaction
  - Limitations: Headless mode does not persist between sessions
  - Security constraints: Container isolation recommended for unattended execution
```

**Considerations**:
- Security implications of unattended code execution
- Container infrastructure requirements (Docker Dev Containers)
- Network isolation for headless instances
- Audit report validation before action

**Benefits** (If Implemented):
- Continuous compliance checking in CI/CD pipeline
- Early detection of protocol violations before human review
- Reduced manual audit workload for routine checks

- Token budget preservation paramount for T04 prompts
- Avoid feature creep through disciplined scope management

### Backward Compatibility
- Enhancements must not break existing protocol workflows
- Projects without .claude/ directory remain fully functional
- Opt-in adoption for new features

### Human Control Preservation
- Hooks and automation cannot bypass approval gates
- Critical transitions (design approval, code generation, test acceptance) require human review
- Automated compliance checking supplements rather than replaces human judgment

### Git Integration
- All new artifacts respect existing .gitignore patterns
- Skills checked into git for team sharing
- Personal configurations excluded via .local naming convention

### Platform Agnostic
- Skills and CLAUDE.md avoid hardcoded platform assumptions
- Platform-specific details remain in design documents per P06 1.7.17
- Cross-platform portability maintained

### Security Boundaries
- Headless mode requires container isolation
- Wildcard permissions scoped to specific command namespaces
- Hook execution in forked contexts prevents unintended side effects

## 2.0 Source

```yaml
source:
  origin: "requirement_change"
  test_ref: ""
  description: >
    Enhancement request to implement govwatch, a standalone read-only
    governance monitoring TUI for downstream projects, per approved
    requirements (requirements-govwatch.md v0.3) and component design
    (design-govwatch.md v0.1). Tactical Domain is Claude Code. Governance
    documents reside in dev/; the deliverable is framework/ai/src/govwatch.py.

## 4.0 Behavior

```yaml
behavior:
  expected: >
    A read-only TUI (govwatch) exists, providing: workflow-phase inference
    from open workspace documents; two-tier compliance scanning (filename/
    structure and document content); a document registry grouped by UUID;
    and an alert summary emitted to the clipboard and to dashboard-alerts.md.
  actual: >
    No such tool exists. Workflow state and governance compliance must be
    assessed manually by reading workspace documents and AEL state files.
  impact: >
    No automated detection of issue/change/prompt coupling violations,
    UUID/iteration mismatches, malformed tactical_brief, or indicators of
    Strategic Domain protocol drift. Oversight is wholly manual.
  workaround: "Manual inspection of workspace/ and .ael/ralph/."
```

## 5.0 Analysis

```yaml
analysis:
  root_cause: >
    New capability. Not a defect. The framework provides no situational-
    awareness tooling for downstream governance state.
  technical_notes: >
    Single-tier component: one Python module (textual + rich), no AEL
    runtime dependency. Design specifies Scanner, PhaseInference,
    ComplianceEngine, AlertWriter, and a textual App. Parsing and compliance
    logic are fully specified in design-govwatch.md §5-§9.

## 6.0 Resolution

```yaml
resolution:
  assigned_to: "Claude Code (Tactical Domain)"
  target_date: ""
  approach: >
    Author framework/ai/src/govwatch.py and requirements-govwatch.txt per
    design-govwatch.md v0.1. Coupled change document (change-7c1d9e02)
    specifies build steps and the deliverable at framework/ai/src/govwatch.py.

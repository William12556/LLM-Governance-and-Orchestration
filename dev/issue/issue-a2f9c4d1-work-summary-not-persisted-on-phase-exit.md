  description: >
    Two live Ralph Loop runs against dev/smoke were executed to validate the
    full ael-mcp path. In both, the worker produced a correct implementation of
    the task deliverable (src/split.py) and the run nonetheless terminated with
    rc=1 having shipped nothing. Root cause is two independent defects in
    run_phase and run_loop, both centred on work-summary.txt.

    run_phase persists work-summary.txt at exactly one of its four exits: the
    normal final-response path (F13, line ~1069). The wall-clock cap exit (line
    ~952), the work-complete.txt detection exit (line ~1267), and the iteration
    exhaustion exit (line ~1272) all return without writing it. Because
    _extract_deliverables reads work-summary.txt to build the deliverable set,
    a phase exiting by any of those three routes leaves real deliverables on
    disk with no manifest — silently disabling the read-evidence gate, the
    syntax gate, and the pytest gate, all of which key on that set.

    Separately, iteration exhaustion returns rc=1, and run_loop aborts on any
    non-zero work-phase rc (line ~1765). A worker that produced correct,
    complete deliverables but ran out of its tool-call budget therefore never
    reaches the review phase at all.

reproduction:

  steps:
    - "Seed a project with a task requiring one or more file writes"
    - "Set loop.phase_max_iterations low enough that the worker writes deliverables but does not reach a final response"
    - "Run --mode loop"
    - "Observe: deliverables exist on disk; work-summary.txt is absent; run exits rc=1 without a review phase"
  frequency: "always"

behavior:
  expected: >
    A worker phase that produced deliverables presents a manifest to the review
    phase regardless of how the phase terminated, and the reviewer adjudicates
    the work. Iteration exhaustion is a budget boundary, not a failure — the
    reviewer decides whether the work is complete.
  actual: >
    work-summary.txt is written only on the final-response exit. On the other
    three exits the manifest is absent, so all deliverable-keyed gates no-op.
    On iteration exhaustion the run additionally aborts before review.
  impact: >
    Correct, complete work is discarded. Worse, on the two exits that do reach
    review (wall-clock cap, work-complete), the review proceeds with an empty
    deliverable set, so the read-evidence, syntax and pytest gates pass
    vacuously — a SHIP can be accepted with no gate having examined anything.
  workaround: "Raise phase_max_iterations until the worker reaches a final response. Unreliable — run fc55ecf7 had 12 spare iterations and still never wrote the summary."

environment:
  python_version: "3.11"
  os: "macOS 14+ / Apple Silicon"
  dependencies: []
  domain: "tactical"

analysis:
  root_cause: >
    Two defects. (1) The work-summary.txt persistence step is attached to a
    single exit path rather than to phase termination, so three of four exits
    bypass it. (2) Iteration exhaustion is classified as a phase failure
    (rc=1) rather than a budget boundary, and run_loop treats any non-zero
    work-phase rc as fatal.
  technical_notes: >
    ralph-work.yaml PROCEDURE step 6 instructs the worker to write
    work-summary.txt itself, and a compliant worker reaching a final response
    makes the F13 fallback redundant. Both observed runs show the instruction
    is not reliably followed: run fc55ecf7 received an explicit REVISE naming
    the missing file and still did not write it across a further twelve
    iterations. This is the project's standing instruction-is-not-enforcement
    pattern, and the remedy follows the established precedent — deterministic
    orchestrator-side handling rather than stronger recipe wording.

    Synthesis must be conservative to avoid masking genuine failure: never
    overwrite an existing summary, and write nothing when no successful
    non-state writes were observed, so a phase that produced nothing still
    presents no manifest and still fails.

notes: >
  Discovered during the dev/smoke harness validation that also produced the
  reviewer-model comparison. Three unrelated defects were logged in the same
  session and are not addressed here: bin/propagate.sh excludes the stale path
  ael/state/ rather than state/, and does not exclude ai/context.md; and the
  deployed ael-mcp build resolves state to .ael/ralph rather than
  ai/state/ralph, breaking ael_status.

  Update (2026-07-29, P08 audit audit-p08-20260729): change-a2f9c4d1 as
  implemented did not fully close this issue. The manifest it introduced was
  cleared only once per run rather than once per cycle, so from loop cycle 2
  onward a manifest left by a prior cycle suppressed synthesis and was
  re-presented to the gates as though it were current — live-confirmed in run
  a2d10058, which contains exactly one write call, in cycle 1, yet returned
  rc=0 in cycle 2 with zero writes. A related defect (move/rename deliverables
  recorded at their pre-move location) was found in the same review. Both are
  addressed by change-f5c28a04, which narrows work-summary.txt's lifetime to a
  single cycle and derives the exhaustion return code from the phase's own
  outcome rather than file presence. This issue remains open pending
  end-to-end verification of change-f5c28a04, which is itself blocked on
  change-3b9e6d72 (no reviewer verdict was reachable as SHIP before that fix).

  description: >
    After an audit loop SHIPs, audit-index.md and audit-report.md remain in
    ai/state/ralph/ and must be manually copied to ai/workspace/audit/ with
    canonical naming. This is an error-prone manual step that should be
    automated.

affected_scope:
  components:
    - name: "orchestrator"
      file_path: "ai/ael/src/orchestrator.py"
  version: "current"

reproduction:
  prerequisites: "Audit loop run to SHIP completion."
  steps:
    - "Launch audit loop with --mode loop --task <uuid>-audit.md"
    - "Loop SHIPs successfully"
    - "Observe: audit-report.md remains in ai/state/ralph/ with no archive copy"
  frequency: "always"

behavior:
  expected: >
    On SHIP, audit-index.md and audit-report.md are automatically copied to
    ai/workspace/audit/ as audit-<uuid>-index.md and audit-<uuid>-report.md.
    UUID is derived from the --task filename.
  actual: >
    Files remain in ai/state/ralph/. Archiving requires manual cp command
    per ai/doc/guide-audit-loop.md §7.3.
  impact: "Manual step; risk of missed archiving or incorrect naming."
  workaround: "Manual cp per guide-audit-loop.md §7.3."

resolution:
  approach: >
    Add _archive_audit_artifacts() to orchestrator.py. Call from main_async
    after run_loop returns rc=0 in loop mode. Add audit-index.md and
    audit-report.md to _RESET_FILES.

verification:
  verification_steps:
    - "Run audit loop to SHIP; confirm both files appear in ai/workspace/audit/ with correct names"
    - "Run --mode reset; confirm audit-index.md and audit-report.md are cleared from state"
    - "Run standard Ralph Loop (non-audit); confirm no archive attempt is made"

notes: "UUID is extracted from --task basename via re.search(r'[0-9a-f]{8}', ...). Fallback: yyyymmdd timestamp."

## 2.0 Source

```yaml
source:
  origin: "user_report"
  test_ref: ""
  description: >
    Surfaced during verification of the ai/ consolidation. ael-mcp/server.py
    hardcodes the loop state directory as _STATE_REL = ".ael/ralph". The
    consolidation relocated loop state to ai/state/ralph/ (orchestrator reads
    loop.state_dir from config.yaml). server.py was not updated and now points
    at the pre-consolidation location.

## 4.0 Behavior

```yaml
behavior:
  expected: >
    ael_status reports state from ai/state/ralph/; start_ael seeds the run
    record there; reset_ael clears it there. The server and the orchestrator
    agree on the state location.
  actual: >
    server.py derives state_dir = root / ".ael/ralph". start_ael writes the
    run record and log to .ael/ralph/ while the orchestrator writes loop state
    to ai/state/ralph/. ael_status reads .ael/ralph/ and reports idle or stale
    state. The server and orchestrator disagree.
  impact: >
    AEL launched via the Claude Desktop ael-mcp tools misreports state against
    any project migrated to the ai/ layout. start_ael seeds state in the wrong
    directory; ael_status cannot observe the orchestrator's actual progress.
    AEL launched directly from the terminal is unaffected (the orchestrator
    reads loop.state_dir from config.yaml correctly).
  workaround: "Launch AEL from the terminal rather than via ael-mcp tools."

## 5.0 Analysis

```yaml
analysis:
  root_cause: >
    server.py defines the state path as a hardcoded module constant
    (_STATE_REL = ".ael/ralph") rather than reading loop.state_dir from the
    project's config.yaml. The ai/ consolidation changed the canonical state
    location to ai/state/ralph; the hardcoded constant was not updated.
  technical_notes: >
    _validate_project() already resolves the path to config.yaml but does not
    parse it; state_dir is computed solely from the constant. The minimal,
    reliable fix is to correct the constant to "ai/state/ralph". A
    config-driven alternative (parse loop.state_dir from config.yaml) was
    considered but rejected: it adds a YAML-parser dependency to a server whose
    only current dependency is mcp, for marginal benefit, since state_dir is
    fixed by convention.

## 6.0 Resolution

```yaml
resolution:
  assigned_to: "Tactical Domain (Claude Code)"
  target_date: ""
  approach: >
    Implement via change-c4a9f2e1 and prompt-c4a9f2e1. Correct _STATE_REL to
    "ai/state/ralph", update the ael_status docstring, and align the .ael/ralph
    references in README.md and DESIGN.md.

  fix_description: >-
    Implemented and verified by source inspection in the ael-mcp repository:
    server.py _STATE_REL is now "ai/state/ralph" and the ael_status docstring
    updated; README.md and DESIGN.md references all read ai/state/ralph/.

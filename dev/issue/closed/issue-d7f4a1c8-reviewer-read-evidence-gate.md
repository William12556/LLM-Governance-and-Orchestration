  description: >
    Observed during concurrent model-routing testing: the reviewer (Magistral)
    emitted a verdict without evaluating the actual worker output. In the ralph
    (non-audit) loop nothing requires the reviewer to read the deliverable files
    before SHIP. The verdict is derived solely from the reviewer's final-message
    token (_normalize_verdict), so a confabulated SHIP with zero read calls is
    accepted. The audit path already gates SHIP on coverage; the ralph path has
    no equivalent evidence gate.

affected_scope:
  components:
    - name: "orchestrator (run_phase, run_loop)"
      file_path: "ai/ael/src/orchestrator.py"
  version: "current"

reproduction:
  prerequisites: "Ralph Loop (--mode loop), reviewer that emits SHIP without issuing read calls."
  steps:
    - "Worker completes; work-summary.txt lists deliverable files"
    - "Reviewer final message begins with SHIP but the phase issued no read/read_file/read_text_file calls on those files"
    - "run_loop normalises the verdict to SHIP and exits; deliverables never inspected"
  frequency: "intermittent"
  reproducibility_conditions: "Depends on reviewer model behaviour; more likely with a heterogeneous reviewer that under-uses tools."
  error_output: "SHIPPED panel with no reviewer reads of deliverables in the .LOG."

behavior:
  expected: >
    SHIP is accepted only when the reviewer has actually read each deliverable
    named in work-summary.txt. An unfounded SHIP is overridden to REVISE.
  actual: >
    SHIP is accepted from the final-message token regardless of whether the
    reviewer read any deliverable.
  impact: "Loop can emit unfounded approvals; defective or absent output ships undetected."
  workaround: "Manual post-SHIP code review (P08) — outside the loop."

analysis:
  root_cause: >
    Verdict acceptance in run_loop depends only on _normalize_verdict of the
    reviewer output. run_phase tracks read-family calls in _read_counts but does
    not surface them to run_loop, and no gate cross-checks reads against the
    deliverable set. The reviewer recipe instructs reading (procedure step 3) but
    instruction is not enforcement.
  technical_notes: >
    Add a deterministic, orchestrator-side gate mirroring the existing audit
    SHIP-gate override: before accepting SHIP in the non-audit loop, require that
    the reviewer read each deliverable file (from work-summary.txt) that exists on
    disk; otherwise override to REVISE naming the unread file(s).

resolution:
  approach: >
    Orchestrator read-evidence gate on the ralph SHIP path. Deliverable set from
    work-summary.txt; reviewer read set from run_phase; override SHIP->REVISE on
    any unread deliverable. Audit path unaffected.

  fix_description: >
    run_phase now returns an abspath-normalized set of reviewer read/read_file/
    read_text_file paths (empty for worker phase). run_loop adds a read-evidence
    SHIP gate on the non-audit path: deliverables are extracted from
    work-summary.txt (files that exist on disk), abspath-normalized, and
    diffed against the reviewer's read set. Any unread deliverable overrides
    SHIP to REVISE with feedback naming the file(s); an empty deliverable set
    is a no-op. Audit SHIP/coverage/scope gates are unmodified.

verification:
  verified_date: "2026-07-16"
  verified_by: "Claude Desktop (P08 strategic audit)"
  test_results: >
    All six T04 success criteria confirmed by inline code review of the
    implemented orchestrator.py: unread deliverable overrides SHIP to REVISE
    naming the file; all-read SHIP ships; empty deliverable set is a no-op;
    abspath normalisation on both path sets prevents relative/absolute
    mismatch false-REVISE; audit SHIP/coverage/scope gates unmodified
    (gate is wrapped in an audit_original_count is None guard); no syntax
    errors (independently confirmed via py_compile). One minor, non-blocking
    inconsistency noted: the F28 phase-wall-clock-cap early return in
    run_phase does not abspath-normalize its returned read set, unlike the
    other three return sites. Edge case only (requires phase_duration_minutes
    configured and the cap firing specifically during the review phase);
    does not affect any of the six success criteria. Logged to dev/todo.md
    rather than reopening this cycle.
  closure_notes: >
    Verified against source by Claude Desktop P08 inline review. No runtime
    Ralph Loop execution performed as part of this verification.
  verification_steps:
    - "Reviewer SHIP with zero reads of a deliverable is overridden to REVISE; feedback names the file"
    - "Reviewer SHIP after reading all deliverables ships"
    - "Empty/unresolvable deliverable set -> gate no-op (SHIP allowed), logged"
    - "Absolute vs relative path forms do not produce a false REVISE"
    - "Audit loop coverage gate behaviour unchanged"

notes: >
  Tier 1 of the reviewer-confabulation analysis. Tier 2 (grounded citation) and
  Tier 3 (heterogeneous reviewer, change-a7d3f8b1) are out of scope here. Source

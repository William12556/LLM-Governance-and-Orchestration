  description: >
    Complete the work-summary manifest lifecycle that change-a2f9c4d1
    introduced, so that each cycle is adjudicated on its own output, and correct
    that document's two overstated claims.

scope:
  summary: >
    Five edits to orchestrator.py and two to config.yaml. (1) Clear
    work-summary.txt at the top of each loop cycle. (2) Track manifest
    production within the phase and derive the exhaustion return code from it
    rather than from file existence. (3) Record the destination path for
    move/rename write targets. (4) Return 0 from reset_state when the state
    directory is absent. (5) Add an opt-in log_archive_dir that copies prior run
    logs out of state_dir before each run. Configuration: point reviewer_model
    at the 8-bit Magistral actually in use, and add its context-window entry.

rational:
  problem_statement: >
    change-a2f9c4d1 attached manifest synthesis to phase exit but left the
    manifest's lifetime at run scope. Because synthesis never overwrites an
    existing summary, a manifest that outlives its cycle suppresses the
    mechanism intended to replace it, and the exhaustion exit — which derives its
    return code from that file's presence — returns 0 for a cycle that produced
    nothing. The gates then re-adjudicate the previous cycle's deliverables. The
    vacuous-pass condition a2f9c4d1 set out to close therefore persisted from
    cycle 2 onward.
  proposed_solution: >
    Give the manifest a cycle lifetime, and decide the exhaustion return code
    from what the phase itself did rather than from what is on disk. The two are
    independently sufficient; implementing both leaves the return code correct
    even if a future caller clears differently.
  alternatives_considered:
    - option: "Clear work-summary.txt before the review phase, alongside review-feedback.txt, as the remediation backlog proposed"
      reason_rejected: >
        The reviewer and all three gates read work-summary.txt. Clearing it at
        that point would remove the manifest they exist to check, converting a
        stale-evidence defect into a no-evidence one. review-feedback.txt is
        safe to clear there only because the worker has already consumed it.
    - option: "Clear per cycle and leave the exhaustion exit testing os.path.exists"
      reason_rejected: >
        Correct as written, but the return code would remain coupled to a
        clearing step in a different function. Tracking production within the
        phase makes each exit self-sufficient.
    - option: "Timestamp the manifest and compare against cycle start"
      reason_rejected: >
        Introduces clock dependence and a comparison window for no benefit over
        a boolean tracked in the phase that writes it.
    - option: "Prefer 'destination' unconditionally in write-target recording"
      reason_rejected: >
        Some write tools accept a destination argument with non-move semantics.
        Branching on the move/rename tool names keeps the change surgical and
        leaves every other tool's recording untouched.
    - option: "Write run logs outside state_dir by default"
      reason_rejected: >
        state_dir's self-containment is a design property, and the change would
        propagate to every downstream project. An opt-in archive preserves
        evidence where wanted and changes nothing where not.
  benefits:
    - "Each cycle is adjudicated on its own output; the read-evidence, syntax and pytest gates receive only this cycle's deliverables"
    - "An unproductive cycle again returns rc=1, restoring the fail-fast property change-a2f9c4d1 intended but did not deliver"
    - "Deliverables produced by move_file or rename_file are no longer silently dropped from the manifest"
    - "reset is idempotent, so ael-mcp's reset_ael no longer reports failure on a project that has not yet run"
    - "Run evidence survives between sessions where configured"
  risks:
    - risk: "A worker that legitimately writes its manifest early and produces nothing further now has that manifest cleared at the next cycle boundary"
      mitigation: "That is the intent — the manifest describes one cycle's work. A worker with nothing to add produces no manifest and the phase correctly returns rc=1."
    - risk: "Branching write-target recording on tool name misses a move-like tool named differently"
      mitigation: "The branch covers the four names in _WRITE_TOOLS with move semantics. An unlisted tool falls through to the prior behaviour, which is no worse than before."
    - risk: "log_archive_dir accumulates logs without bound"
      mitigation: "Copies only; state_dir is still the working location and is still reset normally. Pruning is left to the operator, consistent with the framework's treatment of ai/workspace/."
    - risk: "The .gitignore re-inclusion of ai/logs/ commits run logs that may contain project paths"
      mitigation: "Logs already record absolute paths in state_dir and are reviewed before commit like any other artefact. The archive is opt-in."

technical_details:
  current_behavior: >
    run_loop clears work-summary.txt once, at loop start (~line 1801). The
    exhaustion exit in run_phase synthesises a manifest and then tests
    os.path.exists(work-summary.txt) to choose between rc=0 and rc=1 (~1354).
    Write targets are recorded as `path or file_path or destination` (~1181).
    reset_state returns 1 when state_dir is absent (~507). Run logs are written
    only into state_dir.
  proposed_behavior: >
    work-summary.txt is cleared at the top of each loop cycle, before the work
    phase. run_phase tracks a phase-scoped _manifest_written flag, set when the
    worker writes work-summary.txt via a write tool or via the F13
    final-response path; the exhaustion exit returns 0 when synthesis wrote a
    manifest now or that flag is set, else 1. Write-target recording prefers
    destination for move/rename tools. reset_state returns 0 for an absent
    directory. archive_prior_logs copies *.log and *.LOG from state_dir to
    loop.log_archive_dir before each run, skipping files already present.
  implementation_approach: >
    1. run_loop: add clear_state(state_dir, "work-summary.txt") immediately
    after the iteration.txt write, with a comment recording why the clear sits
    before the work phase and not before the review phase.
    2. run_phase: declare _manifest_written: bool = False alongside
    _written_paths; set it in the F13 final-response branch and in the
    write-target recording block when the target resolves to
    state_dir/work-summary.txt.
    3. run_phase exhaustion exit: capture the return value of
    _synthesize_work_summary and return 0 when it or _manifest_written is true.
    4. Write-target recording: branch on move/rename tool names to prefer
    destination, then new_path, then path, then file_path.
    5. reset_state: return 0 with a "nothing to clear" message when state_dir is
    absent.
    6. New archive_prior_logs(state_dir, archive_dir) -> int near setup_logging;
    call it in main_async before setup_logging, reading loop.log_archive_dir.
    7. config.yaml: add loop.log_archive_dir; correct omlx.reviewer_model to the
    8-bit Magistral and add its model_context_windows entry, retaining the 6-bit
    entry as a valid alternative selection.
    8. .gitignore: re-include ai/logs/ and note the case-insensitive *.log
    collision.

        "work-summary synthesized from 1 observed write(s)", rc=0, gates PASS,
        reviewer REVISE. Cycle 2's worker issued eight tool calls — roots, ls,
        three reads, a grep, and two further reads — and no write of any kind;
        the log then reads "exhausted phase produced no deliverable manifest —
        rc=1" and "work phase rc=1". Under the pre-change code this is exactly
        the case that returned rc=0 on cycle 1's surviving manifest (audit
        finding F1, run a2d10058). Reproduced a second time in run 7135e75d

        SATISFIED as written, and that is the problem. Run 8c2040d3 cycles 1
        and 3 both took this exit. The summary was the worker's final message
        verbatim — in cycle 1, the single sentence "Let me run the manual test
        to verify the implementation:" — and _manifest_written was set. See
        finding N1 below.
      satisfied: true
  finding_raised: >
    N1, recorded in issue-d1f4a83b, severity high. Because the F13 exit
    persists the worker's final message verbatim and this change's
    _manifest_written flag is set there unconditionally, a final response that
    is not a manifest satisfies both the file's presence and the freshness
    test. In run 8c2040d3 cycle 1 the worker had written src/split.py and
    test_manual.py; _extract_deliverables returned 0 files, the syntax, pytest
    and read-evidence gates all no-opped, and the reviewer reported that
    split.py "was not found in the expected location". The per-cycle manifest
    guarantee this change delivers at three exits therefore does not hold at
    the fourth. Corrected under change-d1f4a83b, which is itself unverified
    independently.

    N2, same issue, severity medium: this change corrected the manifest side of
    the `path or file_path or destination` ordering but not the scope-validation
    side. _validate_write_scope still tests one value, so a move supplying its
    source as `path` and a destination outside project_root passes F4
    containment. Reproduced by isolated execution.
  closure_disposition: >
    Left open. Three of seven test cases are unexercised, and finding N1 shows
    the change's central benefit is not delivered at one of the four worker
    exits. The evidence obtained is nonetheless substantial: the F1 defect this
    change was written to close is now directly observed to be closed, twice,
    which no prior session had achieved.

  Implemented directly by the Strategic Domain at William Watson's instruction,
  as was change-a2f9c4d1. Given that a2f9c4d1 was accepted on inline review and
  left three defects a two-cycle run would have exposed, an independent P08
  audit and a live run are both recommended before closure.

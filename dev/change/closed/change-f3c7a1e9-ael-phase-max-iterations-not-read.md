  description: >
    orchestrator.py passed max_iterations (the outer Ralph Loop cycle limit)
    to run_phase() as its inner tool-call iteration limit. config.yaml
    phase_max_iterations was read but never forwarded to run_phase().
    The two limits were therefore identical, making independent control
    impossible. Non-trivial tasks requiring more tool calls than
    max_iterations permitted caused WORK PHASE FAILED.

scope:
  summary: >
    In each affected orchestrator.py: read phase_max_iterations from
    config.yaml in main_async(); pass it to run_phase() in all call sites
    (worker, reviewer, and loop modes). Where run_loop() does not yet
    accept phase_max_iterations as a parameter, add it and thread it
    through to both internal run_phase() calls.

  affected_designs: []
  out_of_scope:
    - "config.yaml structure — no changes required"
    - "governance.md — no changes required"
    - "run_phase() internals — signature unchanged"
    - "Any other source files"

rational:
  problem_statement: >
    With loop.max_iterations set to a governance-appropriate outer cycle
    value (3-5), any non-trivial task fails immediately in the work phase
    because the inner phase tool-call budget is exhausted. The only
    workaround is to inflate max_iterations to ~20, which also inflates
    the outer loop limit unnecessarily.
  proposed_solution: >
    Read phase_max_iterations separately in main_async() and pass it to
    run_phase() at every call site. run_loop() already receives both values
    in framework/ and skel/ and forwards phase_max_iterations to run_phase()
    internally. GTach and solax-modbus require surgical corrections.
  alternatives_considered:
    - option: "Single unified iteration limit"
      reason_rejected: >
        Forces a trade-off: low value causes phase failure; high value
        allows runaway outer loops. Independent control is the correct design.
  benefits:
    - "loop.max_iterations governs outer Ralph Loop cycle count as intended"
    - "loop.phase_max_iterations governs inner tool-call budget as intended"
    - "All projects consistent with framework canonical implementation"
  risks:
    - risk: "Incorrect phase_max_iterations value in config.yaml causes phase failure"
      mitigation: >
        Fallback default in code: config["loop"].get("phase_max_iterations", max_iter).
        If key absent, behaviour is unchanged from pre-fix state.

technical_details:
  current_behavior: >
    GTach: loop mode correct; worker and reviewer single-phase modes pass
    max_iter to run_phase() instead of phase_max_iter.
    solax-modbus: phase_max_iter not read in main_async(); run_loop() does
    not accept phase_max_iterations parameter; all modes pass max_iter to
    run_phase().
  proposed_behavior: >
    All modes in all projects pass phase_max_iter to run_phase(). Outer
    loop cycle limit and inner phase tool-call budget are independently
    configurable.
  implementation_approach: >
    GTach: two-line change in main_async() — replace max_iter with
    phase_max_iter in worker and reviewer mode run_phase() calls.
    solax-modbus: (1) add phase_max_iter read in main_async();
    (2) add phase_max_iterations parameter to run_loop();
    (3) replace max_iterations with phase_max_iterations in both
    run_phase() calls inside run_loop();
    (4) replace max_iter with phase_max_iter in worker and reviewer
    mode run_phase() calls in main_async();
    (5) pass phase_max_iter to run_loop() call in main_async().

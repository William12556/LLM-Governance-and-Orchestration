## 2.0 Scope

```yaml
scope:
  summary: >
    Add govwatch, a single-module read-only governance monitoring TUI, and
    its dependency manifest. Implementation follows design-govwatch.md v0.1.
  affected_components:
    - name: "govwatch module"
      file_path: "framework/ai/src/govwatch.py"
      change_type: "add"
    - name: "govwatch dependency manifest"
      file_path: "framework/ai/src/requirements-govwatch.txt"
      change_type: "add"
  affected_designs:
    - design_ref: "dev/design/design-govwatch.md"
      sections: ["all"]
  out_of_scope:
    - "Modification of sync-skel.sh / propagate.sh — ai/src/ already in rsync scope (OQ-05)"
    - "Downstream .gitignore edit for dashboard-alerts.md (OQ-04) — deferred, requires separate human decision"
    - "Tests directory — no automated tests this iteration; validation is manual TUI run"
```

## 3.0 Rationale

```yaml
rationale:
  problem_statement: >
    No tooling provides situational awareness of downstream governance state.
    Workflow phase, document coupling integrity, tactical_brief validity, and
    AEL status must be assessed manually (issue-7c1d9e02).
  proposed_solution: >
    Implement govwatch per design-govwatch.md: a polling textual/rich TUI with
    a Scanner producing an immutable snapshot, PhaseInference, a two-tier
    ComplianceEngine, and an AlertWriter emitting to the clipboard and to
    dashboard-alerts.md (the sole write target).
  alternatives_considered:
    - option: "Web dashboard"
      reason_rejected: "Requires a server process and browser dependency; rejected in requirements §9.1."
    - option: "Extend AEL orchestrator with monitoring"
      reason_rejected: "Couples a read-only observer to the execution loop; violates separation and read-only constraint."
  benefits:
    - "Automated detection of coupling and tactical_brief violations"
    - "Clipboard payload pasteable into Claude Desktop for Strategic Domain review"
    - "No runtime dependency on AEL modules"
  risks:
    - risk: "Document parsing assumptions diverge from future template changes"
      mitigation: "Parsing mirrors orchestrator strategy and schema required-lists; design §9 records the contract."
    - risk: "AEL 'running' status inferred from state files may be stale"
      mitigation: "Documented limitation; status derived without process inspection per NFR-03."
```

## 4.0 Technical Details

```yaml
technical_details:
  current_behavior: "No govwatch tool exists."
  proposed_behavior: >
    python ai/src/govwatch.py launches a TUI from a downstream project root,
    polling at a configurable interval, rendering Workflow State, Compliance
    Alerts, and Document Registry panels, and writing dashboard-alerts.md.
  implementation_approach: >
    Tactical Domain (Claude Code) authors the single module per
    design-govwatch.md §5-§12. Elements per design §12.0 Element Registry.
  code_changes:
    - component: "govwatch module"
      file: "framework/ai/src/govwatch.py"
      change_summary: >
        Implement ProjectPaths, DocumentRecord, AelState, BudgetState, Alert,
        Snapshot dataclasses; Scanner, PhaseInference, ComplianceEngine,
        AlertWriter; GovwatchApp (textual.App); validate_project,
        parse_filename, parse_document, main. CLASS_DIRS maps class to
        workspace subdirectory (issue -> issues/).
      classes_affected:
        - "ProjectPaths, DocumentRecord, AelState, BudgetState, Alert, Snapshot"
        - "Scanner, PhaseInference, ComplianceEngine, AlertWriter, GovwatchApp"
      functions_affected:
        - "validate_project, parse_filename, parse_document, main"
    - component: "dependency manifest"
      file: "framework/ai/src/requirements-govwatch.txt"
      change_summary: "List textual and rich."
  interface_changes: []

## 5.0 Testing

```yaml
testing:
  approach: >
    Manual validation run from a downstream project root that contains
    workspace/ and (optionally) .ael/ralph/. No automated tests this iteration.
  test_cases:
    - scenario: "Run against a project with a coupled issue+change pair"
      expected_result: "Registry groups the pair by UUID; no coupling violation."
    - scenario: "Run against a project with a T02 lacking its T03"
      expected_result: "VIOLATION alert FR-02-01; red in Compliance panel."
    - scenario: "Run against a T04 with empty/placeholder tactical_brief"
      expected_result: "VIOLATION alert FR-02-10."
    - scenario: "Absent .ael/ralph/"
      expected_result: "AEL status Idle; no exception (NFR-05)."
    - scenario: "Press C, R, Q"
      expected_result: "Clipboard payload copied; immediate refresh; clean quit."
    - scenario: "Each scan"
      expected_result: "dashboard-alerts.md overwritten with current state only (FR-04-04)."
  validation_criteria:
    - "TUI renders three panels without error"
    - "Phase inference matches design §6.0 precedence"
    - "No write occurs outside dashboard-alerts.md (NFR-01)"
    - "Malformed document yields WARNING, not unhandled exception (NFR-04)"
```

## 6.0 Implementation

```yaml
implementation:
  steps:
    - step: "Claude Code: author framework/ai/src/govwatch.py per design-govwatch.md and prompt-7c1d9e02"
      status: "pending"
    - step: "Claude Code: create framework/ai/src/requirements-govwatch.txt (textual, rich)"
      status: "pending"
    - step: "William: manual validation run from a downstream project root"
      status: "pending"
    - step: "William: propagate via bin/sync-skel.sh then bin/propagate.sh <project>"
      status: "pending"
    - step: "William: set issue-7c1d9e02 status to resolved after verification"
      status: "pending"
  rollback_procedure: "Remove framework/ai/src/govwatch.py and requirements-govwatch.txt; restore from git history."
  deployment_notes: >
    govwatch propagates automatically — ai/src/ is within the recursive rsync
    scope of both scripts; no script modification required (OQ-05).

## 1.0 Scope

Consolidates the unfinished work stated in `dev/audit/report-2026-07-29-cowork-remediation.md`
(§10.0) and `dev/audit/remediation-2026-07-29.md`. Both `dev/audit/audit-p08-2026-07-29-orchestrator-changes.md`
and `dev/audit/report-ai-inventory-2026-06.md` are complete records with no
outstanding action of their own.

## 2.0 Blocked — Operator Action Required

1. **Push to `origin`.** Four to five commits made in the Cowork remediation
   session are unpushed. The execution environment had no SSH credentials and
   port 22 was refused.

   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/GitHub/LLM-Governance-and-Orchestration
   git log --oneline -5
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Terminate the orphaned process from run `8c2040d3`** (reported PID 22391,
   blocked in `input()` since 12:53 on 2026-07-29). Verify the process is still
   present before acting — it may already have been reaped.

   ```bash
   kill 22391
   ```

## 3.0 Open Triples

`3b9e6d72`, `f5c28a04` and `d1f4a83b` were closed on 2026-07-29 at William
Watson's explicit instruction, overriding the independent-verification /
live-SHIP preconditions each document stated. See `operator_closure_2026_07_29`
in each change document. The items left unverified at closure are carried
forward in §4.0 below, not treated as resolved.

| Triple | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `a2f9c4d1` | open | Superseded by `f5c28a04`; not itself closed or corrected |
| `3b9e6d72` | closed (operator instruction) | Pass 1 and a live SHIP remain unexercised |
| `f5c28a04` | closed (operator instruction) | 3 of 7 test cases remain unexercised |
| `d1f4a83b` | closed (operator instruction) | N1 remains unconfirmed live |

## 4.0 Verification Debt

- No SHIP has been observed in any live run. Two proximate causes: finding N1
  (now fixed under `d1f4a83b`, itself unverified) and `issue-c7e9a1b3` (worker
  tool-call efficiency, out of scope for this remediation).
- `f5c28a04` test cases unexercised: worker writes its own `work-summary.txt`
  then exhausts budget; deliverable created via `move_file`; `log_archive_dir`
  unset.
- `_normalize_verdict` pass 1 (isolated trailing verdict line) unexercised live.
- Paths never exercised in any run: `BLOCKED` exit in `run_phase`; audit-loop
  recipe pair; pytest gate FAIL branch and SHIP override; stall-detection
  BLOCK at `stall_threshold`.

## 5.0 Human Judgment Required

1. Whether `change-3b9e6d72` should close on its stated criteria alone —
   every validation criterion is satisfied and independently re-derived, but
   its own `issues_found` names a gating verification (a run reaching an
   actual SHIP) that has not been met.
2. Everything named in `prompt-p08-audit-2026-07-29.md` §9.0 and the Cowork
   remediation prompt's §9.0 (see §6.0 below) — not attempted, not concluded
   on.

## 6.0 Explicitly Out of Scope (Not Tasks)

Recorded for completeness; do not action without separate instruction.

- `issue-c7e9a1b3` — worker tool-call efficiency.
- Magistral `[THINK]` instruction-delivery defect — deprioritised, documented
  rationale on file.
- Reviewer criterion-6 calibration — recipe-design judgment call.
- Mistral API evaluation (neutral-framing control, complex-task reasoning
  hypothesis) and prompt-preference/persona experiments.
- Propagating fixes to GTach, solax-modbus, e-Paper-IP-Display. A read-only
  audit of those three found no committed propagation damage, but
  `ai/context.md` is unfilled (template only) in solax-modbus and
  e-Paper-IP-Display — recommended fill before any further AEL run there, not
  a framework defect.
- Grammar-constrained decoding (`guided_grammar`) for the reviewer.
- Stale deployed `ael-mcp` build resolving state to `.ael/ralph` instead of
  `ai/state/ralph` — separate repository (`~/Documents/GitHub/ael-mcp`);
  operational redeploy, not a source defect in this repository.

## 7.0 Filing Anomaly Found During Review — Resolved

While reviewing `dev/audit/`, the local working tree (uncommitted) was found
to have `issue-3b9e6d72`, `change-3b9e6d72`, `prompt-3b9e6d72`,
`issue-d1f4a83b`, `change-d1f4a83b`, `prompt-d1f4a83b`, `issue-f5c28a04`,
`change-f5c28a04` and `prompt-f5c28a04` already moved into their respective
`closed/` subdirectories, while each document's own `closure_disposition`
field stated "Left open" — contradicting the `closed/` placement.

**Resolution (2026-07-29):** William Watson instructed that these three
triples be marked closed and the filing left as-is. The three change
documents and their coupled issue documents were updated in place — status
fields set to `closed`/updated `closure_notes`, and an
`operator_closure_2026_07_29` block added to each change document naming the
items still unverified at closure. The disposition tables in
`dev/audit/report-2026-07-29-cowork-remediation.md` and
`dev/audit/remediation-2026-07-29.md` were updated to match. The three
prompt documents were left unmodified — prompt documents in this project
carry no status field, and their presence in `closed/` is consistent with the
triple's disposition.

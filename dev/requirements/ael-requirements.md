## As-Built Requirements

### Functional

**FR-AEL-001 — Ralph Loop**
The orchestrator shall execute a worker/reviewer cycle (Ralph Loop) iterating until the reviewer emits SHIP or a boundary condition is reached.

**FR-AEL-002 — Execution modes**
The orchestrator shall support four execution modes via `--mode`: `worker` (single work phase), `reviewer` (single review phase), `loop` (full Ralph Loop), `reset` (clear state directory).

**FR-AEL-003 — MCP tool dispatch**
The orchestrator shall connect to one or more MCP servers defined in `config.yaml`, retrieve tool definitions, forward tool calls from the model, and inject results into the message history.

**FR-AEL-004 — Mistral tool call parsing**
The orchestrator shall parse Mistral plain-text tool call format (`[TOOL_CALLS]...[ARGS]...` in the `content` field with `tool_calls: null`) in addition to the OpenAI structured `tool_calls` format.

**FR-AEL-005 — Context budget enforcement**
The orchestrator shall estimate message token count per iteration and enforce configurable warn and abort thresholds expressed as fractions of the model context window.

**FR-AEL-006 — State directory management**
The orchestrator shall read and write loop state files (`task.md`, `iteration.txt`, `work-summary.txt`, `work-complete.txt`, `review-result.txt`, `review-feedback.txt`, `.ralph-complete`, `RALPH-BLOCKED.md`) to the configured state directory.

**FR-AEL-007 — Task extraction from T04 document**
The orchestrator shall extract the `tactical_brief` field from a T04 prompt document passed via `--task`. Pass 1: scan YAML fenced blocks for `tactical_brief` root key. Pass 2 (fallback): extract first fenced block beneath a `## N.N Tactical Brief` section header. If neither pass succeeds, fall back to the raw document.

**FR-AEL-008 — Context window resolution**
The orchestrator shall resolve the model context window by reading `max_position_embeddings` from the model's `config.json` on disk, with optional override via `config.yaml`.

**FR-AEL-009 — Model readiness polling**
The orchestrator shall poll the inference endpoint until the model is listed or the endpoint is reachable, before submitting any completion request. Timeout and interval are configurable.

**FR-AEL-010 — SHIP/BLOCKED outcome signalling**
On SHIP, the orchestrator shall write `.ralph-complete` to the state directory. On BLOCKED, the orchestrator shall write `RALPH-BLOCKED.md` with failure details and exit with a non-zero return code.

**FR-AEL-011 — Structured log output**
The orchestrator shall write a timestamped log file (`ael_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.LOG`) to the state directory. The log shall include INFO, WARNING, DEBUG, and ERROR levels. The final log entry shall be `AEL end rc=N` on all exits including unexpected termination.

**FR-AEL-012 — Context budget report**
At startup, the orchestrator shall write `context-budget.md` to the state directory with context window size, thresholds, headroom estimate, and guidance for the Strategic Domain.

**FR-AEL-013 — MCP error handling**
The orchestrator shall detect MCP tool errors, inject a corrective user message, and write `RALPH-BLOCKED.md` after a configurable consecutive error threshold is reached.

**FR-AEL-014 — Tool call cap**
The orchestrator shall truncate tool call lists that exceed a configurable per-iteration maximum.

**FR-AEL-015 — Duplicate read detection**
The orchestrator shall log a warning when the model reads the same file path more than once within a phase.

---

### Non-Functional

**NFR-AEL-001 — Single process**
The orchestrator shall run as a single Python process. No background daemons or subprocess spawning beyond MCP server stdio processes.

**NFR-AEL-002 — Async execution**
The orchestrator shall use Python `asyncio` for all I/O-bound operations (inference calls, MCP dispatch).

**NFR-AEL-003 — Config-driven**
All runtime parameters (endpoint URL, model, iteration limits, thresholds, state directory, MCP server definitions) shall be read from `config.yaml`. CLI flags override config values where applicable.

**NFR-AEL-004 — Backward compatibility**
The `--task <file or string>` interface shall remain functional. Changes to task input handling shall not require modification to existing T04 prompt documents.

**NFR-AEL-005 — Minimal dependencies**
Python dependencies shall be limited to those declared in `requirements.txt`. No optional or platform-specific dependencies.

## Proposed Requirements

### Strategic Domain Task Authoring

These requirements replace FR-AEL-007 (task extraction from T04 document).

**FR-AEL-P01 — Task file as primary input**
The orchestrator shall accept a plain-text task file as its primary task input. The task file shall be read verbatim; no YAML parsing or field extraction shall be performed.

**FR-AEL-P02 — Strategic Domain authors task file**
The Strategic Domain shall author the task file directly and place it in the state directory prior to AEL invocation. The orchestrator shall read `state_dir/task.md` when no `--task` argument is provided.

**FR-AEL-P03 — Removal of extract_tactical_brief**
The `extract_tactical_brief()` function and all associated fallback logic shall be removed from the orchestrator. The T04 document parsing responsibility is transferred to the Strategic Domain.

**FR-AEL-P04 — Backward-compatible --task flag**
The `--task <file>` flag shall remain. When a file path is provided, the orchestrator shall read the file verbatim as the task string. No extraction or parsing shall be applied.

---

### Pipeline Mode

**FR-AEL-P05 — Pipeline execution mode**
The orchestrator shall support a `pipeline` execution mode invoked via `--mode pipeline --tasks <tasks_dir>`.

**FR-AEL-P06 — Task queue discovery**
In pipeline mode, the orchestrator shall scan the specified tasks directory for files matching `*.md`, sort them by filename in ascending lexicographic order, and treat this sorted list as the execution queue. Filename prefix ordering (e.g. `001-`, `002-`) determines precedence.

**FR-AEL-P07 — Per-task state isolation**
In pipeline mode, each task shall execute with its own state subdirectory: `state_dir/<task-stem>/` where `<task-stem>` is the task filename without extension. State files shall not be shared between tasks.

**FR-AEL-P08 — Task resumption**
In pipeline mode, the orchestrator shall skip any task whose state subdirectory contains `.ralph-complete`. This enables resumption after a BLOCKED state without re-executing completed tasks.

**FR-AEL-P09 — Halt on BLOCKED**
In pipeline mode, if any task exits BLOCKED, the orchestrator shall halt the pipeline, log which task blocked, and exit with a non-zero return code. Subsequent tasks shall not execute.

**FR-AEL-P10 — Shared MCP connection**
In pipeline mode, a single MCP connection shall be established at pipeline start and shared across all task executions. The connection shall be closed after the final task completes or on pipeline halt.

**FR-AEL-P11 — Pipeline log**
The orchestrator shall write a pipeline-level log entry for each task: task filename, start time, and outcome (SHIP, BLOCKED, or SKIPPED).

**FR-AEL-P12 — config.yaml tasks_dir**
The tasks directory path shall be configurable via `config.yaml` under `pipeline.tasks_dir`. The `--tasks` CLI flag shall override this value.

## Constraints

- Target platform: Apple Silicon (M-series), macOS, Python 3.11+
- Inference endpoint: oMLX OpenAI-compatible API (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`)
- Model: Devstral (Mistral-family); tool call format is Mistral plain-text
- MCP transport: stdio only
- State directory is ephemeral and excluded from git

[Return to Table of Contents](<#table of contents>)

## Open Issues

| ID | Description |
|---|---|
| OI-001 | Devstral tool call format (Mistral plain-text) is incompatible with standard OpenAI tool loop; orchestrator owns the dispatch loop externally as a workaround |
| OI-002 | oMLX MCP native tool execution non-functional (GitHub issue #71); oMLX serves as inference backend only |
| OI-003 | Dependency ordering between pipeline tasks is not formally specified; filename sequence implies dependency but is not enforced |
| OI-004 | Pipeline mode: behaviour when tasks directory is empty or contains no `.md` files is not defined |

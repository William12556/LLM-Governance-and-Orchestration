## 1.0 Protocols (Directives)

#### 1.1 P00 Governance (start here)

  - §1.1.1 Purpose
    - Python based software engineering, architecture and development
  - §1.1.2 Scope
    - Agnostic plan, control and initiation of software generation
  - §1.1.3 Framework Practice
    - This governance framework defines software development processes and workflows
    - Strategic Domain/Tactical Domain separation applies to software creation, not to generated application runtime
    - Generated software/applications (outputs) are independent of framework architecture
    - Framework controls: how we build software
    - Framework does not control: how the built software operates
    - Example: \<project name\> uses this framework for development but is a standalone Python application at runtime
  - §1.1.4 Architecture (Model-Agnostic)
    - Strategic Domain: Plan and control: design, change, test and launching of code generation
      - Implementation options: Claude Desktop, local LLM via Goose, API-based LLM
    - Tactical Domain: Execute: code generation
      - Implementation options: Ralph Loop (Goose), custom agents, direct invocation
    - Communication: MCP filesystem (model-independent)
  - §1.1.5 Forbidden
    - Both domains: Unrequested creation, addition, removal or change of source code and documents is forbidden
  - §1.1.6 Constraints
    - Strategic Domain: Does not exceed language model context resource budget when communicating with Tactical Domain
  - §1.1.7 Control
    - Strategic Domain: Strategic coordination and validation authority
    - Strategic Domain: Analyzes requirements and formulates design specifications
    - Strategic Domain: Creates T04 prompts with complete technical context
    - Strategic Domain: Validates Tactical Domain implementation for protocol compliance
    - Strategic Domain: Coordinates quality assurance and integration verification

    - Tactical Domain: Validates protocol compliance through direct file access
    - Tactical Domain: Coordinates multi-file implementations and dependencies

  - §1.1.8 Communication
    - Both Strategic Domain and Tactical Domain have MCP filesystem access to project
    - Model Implementation Details:
      - Strategic Domain model specified in project configuration
      - Tactical Domain model(s) specified in execution recipes
      - Multi-model orchestration supported (e.g., worker/reviewer pattern)
    - Communication uses filesystem-based message passing (semaphores)
    - Strategic Domain: Reads template from ai/templates/T04-prompt.md
    - Strategic Domain: Uses T04 template to create code generation or debug prompts for Tactical Domain
    - Strategic Domain: Embeds complete Tier 3 component design specifications and schema within prompt documents
    - Strategic Domain: Ensures prompt documents are self-contained requiring no external file references
    - Strategic Domain: Saves T04 prompt to workspace/prompt/prompt-\<uuid\>-\<name\>.md
    - Strategic Domain: Provides ready-to-execute command in conversation after human approval
    - Human: Executes provided command to invoke Tactical Domain with T04 prompt
    - Tactical Domain: Reads T04 prompt from workspace/prompt/
    - Tactical Domain: Analyzes project structure and existing code via MCP filesystem access
    - Tactical Domain: Generates code, saves directly to src/ per T04 specifications
    - Human: Notifies Strategic Domain when code generation complete
    - Strategic Domain: Reviews generated code, proceeds with audit
  - §1.1.9 Quality
    - Human review and approval of design, change and initiation of code generation is required
    - Strategic Domain: Provides ready-to-execute command after human approval
    - Human: Invokes Tactical Domain with provided command
    - Human: Notifies Strategic Domain when Tactical Domain completes
    - Strategic Domain: Reviews generated code before proceeding
  - §1.1.10 Documents
    - Master documents: \<document class\>-\<document name\>-master.md
      - No UUID assigned (master documents are singletons per project)
      - Examples: design-myproject-master.md, trace-traceability-matrix-master.md
    - All other documents: \<document class\>-\<uuid\>-\<document name\>.md
      - Strategic Domain: Generates 8-character UUID (first 8 hex digits of UUID v4)
      - Examples: change-a3f5b2c1-fix-parser.md, issue-d7e9f1a4-network-timeout.md
    - Strategic Domain: Design documents follow tier naming convention: master_, domain_, component_ prefixes
    - Strategic Domain: Insures related documents are Obsidian cross linked
    - Document classes that require a master document are: design, audit, trace and test
    - All document classes (issue, change, prompt, test, result) contain internal iteration field starting at 1
    - Iteration increments when document enters new cycle after failed verification

    - Loop Execution: Worker/reviewer cycle until SHIP or boundary exceeded
    - Loop Exit: Generates T06 Result (success) or T03 Issue (failure)
    - State Files:
      - `task.md`: Task description from T04

      - New work requires new document with new sequence number
      - Reopening closed work: Create new issue referencing closed documents
  - §1.1.15 Logging Standards
    - Generated applications implement environment-based log level control
    - Debug mode enables verbose logging for development and testing
    - Normal mode restricts logging to informational events only
    - Flat file format recommended: timestamp level logger message
    - Centralized log location per application requirements
    - Log rotation policy prevents disk exhaustion
    - Test environments use debug mode for comprehensive logging
    - Production environments use normal mode for operational efficiency
    - Log artifacts preserved for failure analysis
  - §1.1.16 Knowledge Base
    - Strategic Domain: Consults workspace/knowledge/ before creating documents or code
    - Tactical Domain: Consults workspace/knowledge/ before implementing changes
    - Both domains: Add newly discovered patterns and solutions to knowledge base
    - Knowledge documents contain: problem statements, solutions, examples, rationale
    - Behavioral standards: workspace/knowledge/behavioral-standards.yaml defines deterministic behavioral constraints for autonomous execution
    - Behavioral standards: Referenced in T04 prompts via behavioral_standards.source field
    - Behavioral standards: Enforcement levels (strict, advisory, disabled) control constraint application
    - Knowledge base prevents repeated problem-solving across development cycles

    - Skills organization: governance/, testing/, validation/, audit/ subdirectories
    - Hot-reload enabled: Skill modifications activate without session restart
    - Forked contexts: Validation skills execute in isolated sub-agent contexts
    - Lifecycle hooks: PreToolUse (schema validation), PostToolUse (compliance verification), Stop (cleanup)
    - Skills repository: Project-specific skills checked into git for team sharing
    - Personal skills: ~/<skills_dir>/ for individual workflow preferences

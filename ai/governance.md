## 1.0 Protocols (Directives)

#### 1.1 P00 Governance (start here)

  - §1.1.1 Purpose
    - Python based software engineering, architecture and development
  - §1.1.2 Scope
    - Agnostic plan, control and initiation of software generation
  - §1.1.3 Framework Practice
    - This governance framework defines software development processes and workflows
    - Claude Desktop/Claude Code separation applies to software creation, not to generated application runtime
    - Generated software/applications (outputs) are independent of framework architecture
    - Framework controls: how we build software
    - Framework does not control: how the built software operates
    - Example: \<project name\> uses this framework for development but is a standalone Python application at runtime
  - §1.1.4 Architecture
    - Claude Desktop (domain 1): Plan and control: design, change, test and launching of code generation
    - Claude Code (domain 2): Execute: code generation
  - §1.1.5 Forbidden
    - Both domains: Unrequested creation, addition, removal or change of source code and documents is forbidden
  - §1.1.6 Constraints
    - Claude Desktop: Does not exceed language model context resource budget when communicating with Claude Code
  - §1.1.7 Control

    - Claude Desktop: Uses T04 template to create code generation or debug prompts for Claude Code
    - Claude Desktop: Embeds complete Tier 3 component design specifications and schema within prompt documents
    - Claude Desktop: Ensures prompt documents are self-contained requiring no external file references
    - Claude Desktop: Saves T04 prompt to workspace/prompt/prompt-\<uuid\>-\<name\>.md
    - Claude Desktop: Provides ready-to-execute command in conversation after human approval
    - Human: Executes provided command to invoke Claude Code with T04 prompt
    - Claude Code: Reads T04 prompt from workspace/prompt/
    - Claude Code: Analyzes project structure and existing code via MCP filesystem access
    - Claude Code: Generates code, saves directly to src/ per T04 specifications
    - Human: Notifies Claude Desktop when code generation complete
    - Claude Desktop: Reviews generated code, proceeds with audit
  - §1.1.9 Quality
    - Human review and approval of design, change and initiation of code generation is required
    - Claude Desktop: Provides ready-to-execute command after human approval
    - Human: Invokes Claude Code with provided command
    - Human: Notifies Claude Desktop when Claude Code completes
    - Claude Desktop: Reviews generated code before proceeding
  - §1.1.10 Documents
    - Master documents: \<document class\>-\<document name\>-master.md
      - No UUID assigned (master documents are singletons per project)
      - Examples: design-myproject-master.md, trace-traceability-matrix-master.md
    - All other documents: \<document class\>-\<uuid\>-\<document name\>.md
      - Claude Desktop: Generates 8-character UUID (first 8 hex digits of UUID v4)
      - Examples: change-a3f5b2c1-fix-parser.md, issue-d7e9f1a4-network-timeout.md
    - Claude Desktop: Design documents follow tier naming convention: master_, domain_, component_ prefixes
    - Claude Desktop: Insures related documents are Obsidian cross linked
    - Document classes that require a master document are: design, audit, trace and test
    - All document classes (issue, change, prompt, test, result) contain internal iteration field starting at 1
    - Iteration increments when document enters new cycle after failed verification
    - Git commit required after iteration field modification
    - Filesystem contains only current iteration; GitHub history preserves prior iterations
    - Coupled documents maintain synchronized iteration numbers via explicit UUID references
  - §1.1.11 Configuration Management

## 2.0 Source

```yaml
source:
  origin: "user_report"
  test_ref: ""
  description: >
    Worker model emitted a malformed MCP tool call with missing required
    arguments (path and edits undefined). MCP server returned -32602
    Input validation error. Orchestrator injected the raw error string
    as a tool result but provided no explicit retry instruction to the
    model. Model failed to self-correct and produced a text-only response,
    terminating the phase with the error written to work-summary.txt.
    Loop appeared to complete normally (rc=0 from run_phase) despite
    zero useful work having been performed.

## 4.0 Reproduction

```yaml
reproduction:
  prerequisites: >
    Worker model configured. MCP filesystem server connected with edit tool
    requiring path and edits arguments.
  steps:
    - "Issue a Ralph Loop task requiring MCP filesystem edits"
    - "Worker model produces malformed tool call: edit() with no path or edits arguments"
    - "Observe work-summary.txt contains raw MCP -32602 error string"
    - "Observe review-result.txt absent or REVISE (loop accomplished nothing)"
  frequency: "intermittent"
  reproducibility_conditions: >
    Occurs when worker model generates a tool invocation with missing required
    parameters. More likely under high context pressure or with smaller/weaker
    models that do not reliably format tool arguments.
  error_output: >
    work-summary.txt content:
    [TOOL_CALLS]MCP error -32602: Input validation error: Invalid arguments
    for tool edit: [{"expected": "string", "code": "invalid_type", "path": ["path"],
    "message": "Invalid input: expected string, received undefined"}, {"expected":
    "array", "code": "invalid_type", "path": ["edits"], "message": "Invalid input:
    expected array, received undefined"}]
```

## 5.0 Behavior

```yaml
behavior:
  expected: >
    When a tool call returns an MCP -32602 validation error, the orchestrator
    injects explicit corrective guidance as a user-role message, prompting the
    model to re-examine the tool schema and reissue the call with correct
    arguments. After a configurable number of consecutive MCP errors,
    the orchestrator writes RALPH-BLOCKED.md and exits cleanly.
  actual: >
    Raw MCP error string injected as tool result only. No additional guidance
    provided. Model failed to self-correct. Phase returned rc=0 (apparent
    success) with error content in work-summary.txt. No BLOCKED state written.
  impact: >
    Loop iteration consumed without useful output. Error surfaced only on
    manual inspection of work-summary.txt. Reviewer either writes REVISE
    (loop wastes further iterations) or the issue is missed entirely.
  workaround: "Reset state and re-run. Inspect work-summary.txt after each run."

## 7.0 Analysis

```yaml
analysis:
  root_cause: >
    run_phase() in orchestrator.py dispatches tool calls and injects results
    uniformly regardless of whether the result represents a successful tool
    response or an MCP protocol error. The raw error string (e.g.
    'Error calling edit: -32602: Input validation error...') is injected as
    a tool role message. This is necessary but insufficient: smaller or
    context-pressured models may not recognise this as a signal to retry
    with corrected arguments.

    Two gaps:
    1. No explicit retry instruction injected when MCP error detected.
    2. No consecutive error counter; loop can run to max_iterations
       performing no useful work and exiting with apparent success (rc=0).

  technical_notes: >
    Detection: result string returned by mcp_client.call_tool() begins with
    'Error calling' when an exception is caught. MCP -32602 specifically
    indicates argument validation failure.

    Fix location: run_phase() in orchestrator.py, within the tool dispatch
    loop after result is obtained.

    Proposed changes (confined to run_phase(), no interface changes):

    1. Detect MCP error in result. When detected:
       a. Print prominent warning to terminal (RED).
       b. Log at WARNING level with tool name and error detail.
       c. Append additional user-role message:
          "The previous tool call failed with a validation error. Review
          the required parameters for the tool and reissue the call with
          all required arguments correctly specified."
       d. Increment per-phase mcp_error_count.

    2. After mcp_error_count reaches configurable threshold (default 3):
       a. Write RALPH-BLOCKED.md with error detail.
       b. Return 1 from run_phase().

    Both changes are backward-compatible and confined to run_phase().
    mcp_client.py does not require modification.

## 8.0 Resolution

```yaml
resolution:
  assigned_to: ""
  target_date: ""
  approach: >
    1. Add MCP error detection in run_phase() tool dispatch loop.
    2. Inject explicit retry user message on MCP error detection.
    3. Track consecutive MCP errors; write RALPH-BLOCKED.md at threshold.
    4. Apply fix to framework/ai/ael/src/orchestrator.py and
       skel/ai/ael/src/orchestrator.py. Propagate to project copies.

prevention:
  preventive_measures: >
    Explicit MCP error handling prevents silent loop failure on malformed
    tool calls. Consecutive error threshold prevents wasted iterations and
    provides a clean BLOCKED state for Strategic Domain review.
  process_improvements: >
    Consider adding a recipe instruction to worker prompts reminding the
    model to verify required tool arguments before invocation.
